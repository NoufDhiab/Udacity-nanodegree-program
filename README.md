Projects for my Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

### P1: Explore Weather Trends Project

The first project focus on analyze local and global temperature data and comparing the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends.
The goal of this project is to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where you live.


### P2: Investigate a Dataset Project

The requirement of this project is to choose one Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and pandas. Go through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing your findings.


### P3: Analyze A/B Test Results Project

Understanding the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.


### P4: Wrangle and Analyze Data Project

Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, this project focus on gathering data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assessing its quality and tidiness, then clean it.

The dataset that the poject require to wrangle (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.


### P5: Communicate Data Findings Project

This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process.

- In Part I, Exploratory data visualization, you will use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables.
- In Part II, Explanatory data visualization, you will produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that you discovered in your selected dataset. The primary method of conveying your findings will be through transforming your exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.
